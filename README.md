# 5-Day Forecast Overview
Welcome to my Weather API!  This program is a website that practices using a weather API. I made this website to specifically practice using localStorage as well as to practice fetching a API and displaying the data. The weather images and number are what comes from the API itself(Note the images displayed come with the API and are not the best).  The tempature is displayed in Ferihieght and had to be converted from Kelvin.

# Development Environment

The enviorment that was used was Visual Studio Code by Microsoft.  The languages used were HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  I did also use a little bit of SASS.  If you want to make any changes to the CSS file, make sure to recompile the SASS with the command at the top of the styles.scss file.  Note, you sould also make sure you have SASS.

# Future Work
* Replace the images found with the API with custom images
